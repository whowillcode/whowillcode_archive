<p>March 18, 2019</p>
<p>In the below diagram, I attempt to understand, how a <strong>the socio economic reality of an individual is shaped (or manufactured)</strong> in an internet/media enabled society.</p>

<p>At the center of the problem there are technologies like Whatsapp, Facebook, Youtube, Twitter etc.</p>
<p>The “individuals” (like me) gets to know about the situation of the country through <strong>posts shared by friends in Facebook</strong>, opinions of family members channel he/she views or people he/she aspires to be. From an individual’s perspective these technologies are aggregators (not platforms) <strong>that aggregate stuff with an appeal, as they don’t have an intelligence of their own.</strong> If we examine, this process doesn’t guarantee the correctness of information which gets delivered leaving the individual with the responsibility to think critically about them.</p>
<p>From an actors’ (political person, corporate or influencer) perspective these technologies <strong>aggregate individuals around them and provide insights for targeting their agenda/ideology</strong>. To benefit form the process, actors rig it, by producing biased content or producing content having an emotional appeal. They also game the dumb aggregators by manufacturing a fake enthusiasm (retweets,likes,shares etc) around particular types of contents (using bots or trolls). And thus they are able to manufacture the socio-economic reality. Computational Propaganda is a project by Oxford University attempts to investigate the interaction of technology and politics in depth.</p>
<p><strong>Infinite game</strong></p>
<p>Who will win? I think it’s an <strong>Infinite Game</strong>, it may end apparently but not permanently.</p>
<p>Also the situations can be diverse there <strong>may be a strong actor</strong> trying to prevent opinions against him/her or his/her ideology to surface up , there can be simple bias <strong>or human instincts at play</strong>.</p>
<p>There was a time when people used to believe photoshopped images to be real ones. Now though we are able to differentiate doctored images to a great extent, but we fail to differentiate the deep fakes ( AI generated fake videos). With AI we can change the face of person or we can manipulate what he/she speaks. There can be technological solutions for the problem for example Botivist a twitter bot to troll the trolls, this is great but there will be a tool that will outpace it.</p>
<p>Though trolls are actor sponsored, there can also be situations where information is not sponsored by any actors, and it’s only human instincts that we need to question.</p>
<p>Take for example the efforts of <strong>Hans Rosling</strong> (as described in Ch10, Factfullness) to track whether the actions to control spread of Ebola virus at Liberia was working or not.</p>
<p>In 2014, he was shocked to look at the graphs of World Health Organization, which showed that the new Ebola cases per day was doubling. So he went to Liberia. He figured out that during Ebola outbreak, <strong>normal health services focused on moving resources away from treating other life threatening conditions</strong> in order to deal with Ebola. As a result <strong>people were dying from non Ebola causes</strong>. He wanted to dig further. He found that the blood samples were being sent to four different labs, and their records were in long and messy Excel spreadsheets, which were not combined. He got them organized. And to everybody’s surprise, the data showed that the number of <strong>confirmed Ebola cases had reached a peak two weeks earlier and was now dropping. The number of suspected cases (non Ebola cases) kept increasing</strong>. This actually is critical thinking.</p>
<p>The solution I see is to equip the individual with critical thinking. Asking the individual to dig around the news, compare the data and be open for counter opinions. A recent study by Royal Bank of Canada titled <strong>“Humans Wanted”</strong> which explores ways to make Canadian youth <strong>ready for jos of tomorrow</strong> mentions <strong>“Communication, collaboration and critical thinking will serve you well in any career”</strong>. <u> If we look news in this context I think it’s a perfect tool to develop critical thinking - very simple, readily available tool that helps build social awareness (and to be ready for the jobs of tomorrow)</u>. Discussing them will promote communication and taking action about the information will involve collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Future</strong></p>
<p><strong>A proper method for discussing news in the perspective to develop critical thinking can ultimately result in to internet scale community engagement</strong>. This is a way to see the positive roles media companies and aggregators like Facebook, Twitter etc can play in the society. This view of news also makes the individual responsible for the nature of information one subscribes to. Such a method can gradually change the state of economic issues in of internet enabled societies.</p>
