<h1 id="reimagining-hiring">Reimagining Hiring</h1>
<p><strong>Hiring for the organization</strong></p>
<p>Researchers at MIT Media Lab studied the work history of 40 million people in Brazil they found “that the growth and survival of pioneers (pioneering farms) increase significantly when their first hires are workers with experience in a related industry and with work experience in the same location, but not with past experience in a related occupation. We compare these results with new firms that are not pioneers and find that industry-specific knowledge is significantly more important for pioneer than for non-pioneer firms.”. Industry experience and location can be one of those ‘cuts’ for shortening the list.</p>
<p><strong>The Hiring Process</strong></p>
<p>The way recruitment, happens today is just like the way exams happen in schools and that’s changing, following are few points from Microsoft’s new hiring process for Project Manager role:- Share in advance what problems the candidate will be working on. Run through a real problem the team is trying to solve. Give the candidate access to the internet and the same information that the team is working with.</p>
<p><strong>Hiring for the organizational goals</strong></p>

<p class="caption">The Innovation Ambition Matrix</p>
</div>
<p>In HBR article in Managing Your Innovation Portfolio, Bansi Nagji, and Geoff Tuff propose a 70-20-10 distribution of resources for ensuring innovation in the organization. It suggests allocating 70% of resources on core capabilities (current market domain). 20% of resources in adjacent capabilities - existing knowledge in a new market place. And 10% into capabilities for which markets don't exist yet.</p>
<p><strong>Hiring the Renaissance Man</strong></p>
<p>How fast they can be “average” at random new thing!. The nature of work today requires multiple skill sets, that cannot be standardized into a test. Meeting market requirements is an infinite game that requires people who know how to ‘adapt technological solutions for the strategy’. This reminds me of the definition of Renaissance Man (guys like Leonardo da Vinci!), a person whose expertise spans a significant number of subject areas, known to draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems (Wikipedia definition). Hire people who understand the problem and come to you with what to do, instead of waiting for you to tell them.</p>
