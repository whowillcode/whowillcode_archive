<h1 id="an-alternative-to-predicting-future">An alternative to predicting future</h1>
<p><em>“If you wanted to count every product and service on offer in New York – there are 10 billion of them – it would take you 317 years. This is how complex the economy we’ve created is”</em> - Tim Harford’s, Trial, error and the God complex (TED talk)</p>
<p>Perspectives are more useful that prediction. Take for example <em>“Distribution of intelligence”, The DNA of Information</em> - Being Digital, Nicholas Negroponte: <em>“Instead of thinking of the next evolutionary step of television as increased in resolution, etter color, or more programs, think of it as a change in the distribution of intelligence - or more precisely, the movement of some intelligence, from transmitter to the receiver.”</em></p>
<p>It’s not predicting anything, its giving an insight, an perspective. Let’s apply it to patient care : Drug Companies , Hospitals , Patients.</p>
<p>Drug companies, know how to make drugs and Hospitals know how to treat patients. What about movement of some intelligence from drug companies to hospitals !. Don’t believe me it’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/health/drug-prices-hospitals.html">already happening</a>. Let’s also take into consideration of fact that with advancement in analytics and IoT, we can have devices that do <a href="https://youtu.be/zUZ5YQURvvk?t=171">the diagnosis for the patient</a> or aid the doctor far far away. Added to it patients recover faster when they are in their homes. We now have a different picture of patient care, to built upon, instead of a prediction.</p>
<p>One more - “Subtraction”, and this one is from The End of Cloud Computing by Peter Levine, a16Z :</p>
<p><em>“Everything that’s popular in technology always gets replaced by something else… Subtract something that’s important today and fill it with something.. And you will start to think out of the box”.</em></p>
<p>His argument is as devices collect more data thats needs to be processed in real time, they cannot afford the latency of sending data to central cloud. The solution is to process it in real time, and that’s why cloud becomes obsolete because of very sophisticated that can communicate among themselves devices at the edge of network.</p>
<p>Let’s think. Let’s subtract self driving cars from the cities of future. What do we get - Roads? Can we make the roads smatter?</p>
<p>Insted up making cars intelligent we can make the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/29/business/volkswagen-siemens-smart-traffic-lights/index.html">infrastructure intelligent</a>, intelligent enough to drive people around in smart cars, just like trains, but without rails. Safer, and autonomous.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong - I like self driving technology - they will actually make public infrastructure more accessible, here I am just thinking!. So how will you think.</p>
