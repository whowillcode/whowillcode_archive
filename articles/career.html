<h1 id="the-thing-about-career.">The thing about career.</h1>
<p>I remember one of my friends coming to me and asking me to “enjoy life”, asking me to take a break from my “monotonous” life.. and few other stuff, that you can find in any movie script. If you are committed towards your career you will listen this a lot.</p>
<p>The problem is if you don’t like what you do, you will try to engage in things that provide you an escape from what you normally do. It means my friend was actually not enjoying life and he was following some script with a hope that he will find something to enjoy. He wanted to escape his life, not live it.</p>
<p>Lets actually take up a historical perspective- from daily lives of people living in past. Take an average day to day activity of theirs, wouldn’t it look like a struggle now. Added to this there were droughts, famines and death due to diseases. We are actually enjoying our lives because living standards have gone up and a lot of information is easily accessible.</p>
<p>So my friend you are actually trying to over enjoy your life, what you should try instead is to take off your mind from these new gen bs, and find meaning in what you do.</p>
<p>But why is my friend feeling like this. In India, there is a sudden explosion of engineering talent. With this explosion of talent , there isn’t enough problems visible to solve for the society (more on this coming in my next post). Hence no feeling of attachment (consider Ikea Effect) towards own society.</p>
<p>Added to this disengagement from society, there is a prioritization of wrong values, specifically “Confidence”. The problem with confidence is , it’s more dramatic than real, it is sometimes misunderstood as taking up risks without putting much thought.</p>
<p>Confidence problem can also be seen from a different lens - “Being afraid of not being the best or not having confidence”. We see people trying to be best at one thing and one thing only. And we feel like an imposter among them. Others do so because they are taught to do so. It’s so wrong that it makes us even more fragile in long term.</p>
<p>How? Take a story of a bird and a mammal, dependant on the same tree for food from Getting Ahead By Being Inefficient - Farnam Street. The bird has developed a beak to get under the berry’s shell. It has claws helping it with the tree’s slippery branches. It consumes the berries year round. The bird is the best when it comes to berries. The mammal, gets to taste the berries, occasionally when the bird drops it. But the mammal has adapted to the situation, it goes for the berries in the night, its vision evolves . Also its claws evolve to grip the tree. The bird doesn’t know any other food sources but for the mammal it’s one of many (imperfections).</p>
<p>The author asks to imagine if there is a sudden disruption in vegetation pattern because of climate change and the tree stops producing berries.. who’s in a better position to adapt?</p>
